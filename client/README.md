# Getting Started with Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).


### 1. Navigate to the client folder

Run the following command:

```bash
cd client
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the command below to install all necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Run the frontend locally

To start the frontend development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the React development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4.Backend Dependency

For the frontend to work, ensure the backend (Node.js/Express) server is running. The backend should be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
